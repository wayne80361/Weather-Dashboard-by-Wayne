Hi,

This is a weather-dashboard.
A user can find the current weather information and 5 days forecast base on the city input to the search.

It will show the City Name, date, temperature in both Celsius and Fahrenheit, humidity, and wind speed.

A simple icon will pop out based on the current weather codition of input city.

The historical Search is not clickable and it won't return anything.
